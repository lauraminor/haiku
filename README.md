# Haiku

Like the epic-first-line generator, this project is a part of an exercise to construct a grammar using Python dictionaries. This grammar, however, is meant to generate a haiku-- a three-line poem of five, seven, and five syllables, respectively-- and so the grammar includes words of different syllable-lengths.
